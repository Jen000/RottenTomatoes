# Rotten Tomatoes Data Visualization

Hi, this project focuses on Rotten Tomatoes Movie Reviews. I found three main questions
that I wanted to answer:
- Does a certain genre of movies tend to score better than other genres and how has the quality of those genres changed over time?
- Is there a correlation between the audience score and the critics score of a movie?
- Does content rating have an effect on the critic's score?

I found this data on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stefanoleone992/rotten-tomatoes-movies-and-critic-reviews-dataset?resource=download)
and have been working with it to create a data visualization to answer all of our questions and more. Our goal
is to create a graph that will let it's viewers answer their own questions about the dataset as well.
